An interview is <= 30 min long. Of course, this is not enough time for
the team to present and explain their entire deliverable. So, we will
need careful planning.

Most teams have 5 members at the moment. Each team member needs to
actively participate during the interview for the team to get full
marks for the interview.

Please, make notes -- I will want to keep them for my records. Do not
assign the grade at this point. We will all meet after all interviews
have been completed and decide on grades there. You can explain this
to the teams in advance. We do so to make sure we are as consistent as
possible in grading.

Here is the format I'm hoping you will follow. As always with
interviews, you will need to be flexible. 

1) The process [2]: 1

 Ask for a volunteer to give an overview of the process of completing
 the deliverable. How did they organize themselves, is there a leader
 of any kind, did they assign responsibilities, etc.  Look for
 evidence of making informed decisions, not simply "X and Y had time
 after MAT on Monday, so they came up with a product backlog."
 [see Note below]

-they came up with personas as a group on google docs
-each team member came up with ytwo user stories
-as a group they pruned them and tried to improve each user story
-went over my feedback as a group before submitting
-no group leader
-someone volunteers to put it together and then sent it to the group
for one final review of it
-someone else volunteered to submit the assignment
-volunteered based on free time (-1)


2) Personas [2]: 2

 Ask for a volunteer to explain the process of coming up with their
 personas (not "in theory", but what they actually did).  Ask
 follow-up questions until you're fully satisfied that he or she knows
 what they're talking about. [see Note below]

-for the personas they set up a google docs that everyone edited
-everyone was able to add anything
-found information on his blog / website
-found other projects that he was working on
-they converted information from his slides into his persona
-the second last tutorial had a QA session that gave more specific requirements
for the user
-used for slides to determine his technical skills
-people were asking Hanno questions about easy to use software
and those qualities were added to his persona.


3) Product Backlog [2]: 2

 Ask for a volunteer to explain the process of coming up with a
 product backlog (not "in theory", but what they actually did).  Ask
 follow-up questions until you're fully satisfied that he or she knows
 what they're talking about. [see Note below]

-when making user stories they used Hanno's slides
as well as the Qa session during the second tutorial
-look at the exoplanet catalogue to see what other features he would like
-tried to break these requirements into user stories
-each person went off to create user stories
-pruned user stories as a group
-eliminated duplicates
-fixed levels of specificity
-critized user stories as a group
(is something ambiguous, what would be reuiqred, how do we estimate time)
-also looked at other projects that Hanno made
-almost exclusively through the QA section and slides

4) Details of User Stories [2]: 2

 Ask for a volunteer. Select two user stories from two different
 personas and ask this volunteer to explain these two user stories.
 [see Note below]

user 2.5:
    -Hanno want to take advantage of Github's pull requests rather
     than creating more overhead
    -thought there should be a set time where to check other catalogues
    -once a day will be modifiable
    -this user story will just let Hanno know via a pull requests
    -rather than trying to merge it
    -the pull request will indeed merge the catalogues together, 
    but this user story is just about letting Hanno know


user story 2.8:
    -when other catalogues have conflicting names (could be a typo)
    -wants the program to be able to see if planets are the same even if their names
    are different
    -they want Hanno to manually verify that the programs guess is correct
    -Hanno mentioned this during the QA session
    -this could be done for any column


5) Sprint Backlog [2]: 1

  Ask the remaining team member to explain how the team will choose
  the user stories for the Sprint Backlog. Have him/her point out user
  stories from their Product Backlog that are likely to be chosen.
  [see Note below]

-going to ask Hanno what his priorities are
and when they are assigned, they will also assign a cost
-they will then add the user story to the sprint
-will figure out how long each sprint will be
-assign priorities during team meeting
-did not mention project velocity (-1)

[Note] If nobody volunteers or if nobody is able to give an adequate
 answer, the team does not get this grade.  This volunteer is not
 allowed to volunteer again (except for the last question, if the team
 has 4 members). If a team member declares to be unable to answer
 his/her question, then other members are allowed to help. If the
 collective answer is correct, the team get half the marks for that
 question.


Needless to say, please, take this opportunity to offer as much help
and feedback as possible.
