CSCC01 Deliverable 2 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

Personas:  14 / 20

  Format: 4 / 4

      must contain: gender, age, personality, skills, environment
      (workplace), attitude towards technology in general, attitude
      towards computer software and IT.
 
      Too many irrelevant details are not useful!

  -2 no goals
  Information content:  6 / 8
   
      The purpose of each persona is clear. Personas suggest different
      system requirements. Includes goals when using the
      system. Includes familiarity with version control.


  -4 only one persona
  Coverage: 4 / 8

      personas must include at least two of the following type of users:

      -- "Hanno type"

      -- Hanno's grad student: can approve modifications to the data,
           but cannot add other such users (only Hanno can)

      -- A less tech-savvy astronomer: Sure, Hanno is the client who
           makes the order, but the software will be released as
           open-source, so other types of users are 100% realistic.

      -- (no points removed) User outside of Hanno's team who wants to
         add to DB, but is not familiar with GitHub.


Product Backlog:  37 / 50

    10 / 10 : User stories follow the format
                "As __name__ (__role__), I want __something__."

	       AND each __name__ corresponds to one of the personas.

    -5 only one persona
    5 / 10 : User stories, together, reflect all the user
    	        requirements (from all personas).

    -2 user story 2.18 seems invented
    Why is this a special case?
    8 / 10 : User stories correspond to actual requirements (no
    	        "invented" features).
    
    
    Some user stories are vaugue (see feedback)
    6 / 10 : User stories contain enough information for devs to
                estimate how long it would take to implement it.
    
    -2 shouldn't have UNIX and open source story
    8 / 10 : Each user story addresses one specific requirement (no
                "world peace" stories).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marking format:

Please, produce a text or pdf file for each team. This file should
contain the above rubric. 

Please, provide comments to the teams. I require a comment for each
rubric where you are deducting any marks. But perhaps more
importantly, I would like you to provide enough help to make sure
every team can make good progress on the next stage of the project.

How you should provide comments? I will leave the format to you, since
I know how personal the choice of editor, etc., can be, and I don't
want to slow you down.

Some options in case you are not sure what to choose:
 -- annotate a pdf submission with your comments
 -- add the comments to the file with the rubric
 -- create a separate file for the comments
 -- ... 

I ask that you are consistent: use the same format for each team.

As always, please let me know if you have any questions, concerns,
suggestions, etc.!


Cheers,
A.
