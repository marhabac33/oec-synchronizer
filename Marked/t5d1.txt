2) Introduce the team members: 30 out of 30

   I am assuming 5 members. If your team has four members,
   scale accordingly.

      approx 150 words: 1
      spelling and grammar: 1
      clarity: 1
      professionalism: 2

   The members' introductions are consistent w.r.t. person (in
   first/third person), style, qualities/interests described, etc., so
   that the overall introduction reads well:      5
